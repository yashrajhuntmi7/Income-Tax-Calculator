        <h2>About the Website :</h2>
        <p>
            The Income Tax Calculator is a user-friendly and interactive web tool designed to make tax calculation simple for everyone.
        Paying income tax is a responsibility of every earning individual, but most people find it confusing due to the different slab rates, deductions, and regimes.
        This website aims to remove that confusion by providing a quick and accurate way to calculate your income tax instantly.

        It is specially designed for Indian taxpayers who wish to understand their tax liability under both the Old and New Tax Regimes.
        By entering just a few details such as income, deductions, and age, users can get a clear idea of how much tax they need to pay — and which regime benefits them the most.
        The main purpose is to save time, reduce calculation errors, and promote financial awareness among individuals.

            Purpose and Inspiration
        </h2>
        <p>
            The idea behind this project came from the fact that many individuals, especially students and first-time job holders,
            struggle to understand how income tax is calculated.
            By creating this website, I wanted to combine simplicity with practicality,
            showing that even a basic web tool can help people make better financial decisions.

            It’s also a great way to demonstrate how web development skills can be used for real-world applications that benefit society.
